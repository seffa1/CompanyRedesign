# Company Landing Page
The current company I work at has a 20 year old static website which is not responsive. I wanted to show them what a responsive webpage looked like so I remade their landed page myself. It is mobile friendly with collapsing hamburger menus done in vanilla javascript. There is also a cool automatic changing carasoul wheel.
